# 🤖 Smart Inquiry Replier - Your AI Email Assistant

## 🎯 What Does This Do? (Super Simple Explanation!)

Imagine you have a **magical email helper** that can:
1. 📧 **Read emails** that people send to you
2. 🔍 **Find the questions** they're asking (like "What's your price?" or "How do I reset my password?")
3. 🤖 **Write smart replies** using AI (like having a super smart robot assistant!)
4. 📤 **Send back professional answers** automatically

**Think of it like this:** 
- You get an email: *"Hi John, what are your business hours? Do you offer refunds?"*
- Our AI reads it and thinks: *"Oh! They want to know business hours AND refund policy"*
- It writes back: *"Hello! Our business hours are 9 AM - 6 PM. Yes, we offer 30-day refunds..."*
- All done automatically! ✨

## 🚀 Cool Features (What Makes It Special!)

- 🧠 **Smart Brain**: Uses Google's Gemini AI to understand emails
- 👥 **Name Detective**: Finds who sent the email and who it's for
- ❓ **Question Hunter**: Spots all questions in emails (even tricky ones!)
- 💬 **Professional Writer**: Creates polite, helpful replies
- 📚 **Memory Bank**: Remembers all emails and replies for later
- 🛡️ **Never Breaks**: Works even if AI is having a bad day
- 👨‍💼 **Admin Dashboard**: See everything that's happening behind the scenes

## 🎬 How It Works (Step by Step!)

### Step 1: Email Comes In 📨
Someone sends an email like:
```
"Hi Sarah! How much does your service cost? Can I get a refund if I don't like it? Best, Mike"
```

### Step 2: AI Reads & Understands 🔍
Our smart AI looks at the email and finds:
- **Who sent it**: Mike
- **Who it's for**: Sarah  
- **Questions asked**: 
  - "How much does your service cost?"
  - "Can I get a refund if I don't like it?"

### Step 3: AI Writes Reply ✍️
The AI creates a professional response:
```
"Hello Mike! Thank you for your inquiry. Our service costs $29/month. 
Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied. 
Best regards, Sarah"
```
